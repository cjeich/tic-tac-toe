# TIC TAC TOE

This is a quick demo of a tic-tac-to app

It was originally inspired by an interview question including css for a game board and a question about DOM event listeners.

## Plan
* Set up webpack with react and sass support
* Set up redux with time traveling debugger!
* Set convert html to react components
* Update css to use flexbox
* Set up post-css for css post processing

### Future Improvements
* __[css]__ - Implementing flexbox would make our styles cleaner and more responsive
* __[css]__ - Code would be more maintainable if we used sass and post-processor (e.g. autoprefixr or post-css)
* __[js]__ - We should objects to maintain state, rather than procedurally manipulating the DOM
* __[js]__ - We need a single source of data (redux)
* __[js]__ - We need a way to render that source to the DOM (react)
* __[server]__ - We need to upgrade our stack to render sass/react (webpack)
